# ShortenIt
A small website built using C# and ASP.NET Core that provides a convenient way to shorten long links, making it easier for users to share them. This project was developed in a single day and showcases the capabilities of C# and ASP.NET Core in building web applications quickly.

The website allows users to input a long link and receive a shortened version of it, which can then be shared with others. The shortened links are stored in a database .
